# Problem 1: Spiral Matrix
##### Difficulty: Difficult
##### Date: 2020-02-09

## Problem statement
You will be given a positive integer input N, and your job is to return a spiral matrix list size of NxN. 

#### Constraints
N >= 1

#### Expected output

N = 2

Expected output = 

[[1, 2],

[4, 3]]

--------------------------

N = 3 

Expected output = 

[[1, 2, 3],

[8, 9, 4],

[7, 6, 5]]

#### End of problem statement

## Solution  

```python
def solution(n):

    # Finding the right way to initialize `x` took me almost as much time as solving the rest of the problem orz
    # I started initializing with x = [[0] * n ] * n, but funny things would happen
    x = [[0 for x in range(n)] for y in range(n)] 

    stop = n**2
    m  = 1 # numbers 12345678...stop 
    r = 0 # round

    # fill in the numbers one by one brutally
    while m <= stop:
        # go right
        for i in range(r, n-r):
            x[r][i] = m
            m+=1
        # go down
        for i in range(r+1, n-r):
            x[i][n-r-1] = m
            m+=1
        # go left
        for i in range(n-r-2, r-1, -1):
            x[n-r-1][i] = m
            m+=1
        # go up
        for i in range(n-r-2, r, -1):
            x[i][r] = m
            m+=1
        # next round
        r+=1
        
    return x
```

# Problem 2: Pyramid
##### Difficulty: Moderate
##### Date: 2020-02-17

## Problem statement
You will be given an integer input N and your job is to append to a list a pyramid with exactly that many levels.

#### Expected output: list

Input: N = 2

Please note that the `-` are **not** a part of the output, only to show you that a **space** is required.

Output:

(below is for readability, output should be of the format: [" # ", "###"])

'-#-'

'###'

Input: N = 3

'--#--'

'-###-'

'#####'

## Constraints

Input will be positive integer.

#### End of problem statement

## Solution  
```python
def solution(N):
    return [' '*(N-i-1) + '#'*(2*i+1) + ' '*(N-i-1) for i in range(N)]
```

# Problem 3: Longest Palindromic
##### Difficulty: Moderate
##### Date: 2020-02-20

## Problem statement
You will be given a string `s`, your job is to find and return the longest palindromic substring in `s`. 

#### Expected output
s = "babad"

Output : "bab" - even "aba" is a valid output

-----------------------------------------------
s = "cbbc"

Output : "bb"

#### End of problem statement

## Solution  
```python
def longestPalindrome(s):
    """
    The idea is to iterate and check through all possible combinations, **from the longest to the shortest**, and stop and return as soon as we find one (so that it's the longest one).
    """    
    for i in range(len(s),1,-1):
        for j in range(len(s)):
            if i%2 != 0:

                        return s[j:(i+j)]
            if i%2 == 0:
                if (s[j:int(i/2+j)] == s[int(i/2+j):(i+j)][::-1]):
                        return s[j:(i+j)]
    return 'no palindromic found'

    longest = ''
    for i in range(len(s),1,-1):
        for j in range(len(s)):
            n = s[j:(i+j)]
            if (n == n[::-1]):
                if len(n) > len(longest): # update the longest
                    longest = n
    return longest

# Problem 4: Even Fibonacci numbers
##### Difficulty: Easy
##### Date: 2020-02-22

## Problem statement
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution  
```python
def solution(limit = 4000000):
    s = 2
    m = 1
    n = 2
    x = 0
    while x <= limit:
        x = m+n
        if x%2 == 0:
            s+=x
        m = n
        n = x
    return s

    mm = s-1
    while mm > 1:
        if s%mm == 0:
            return False

# Problem 6: Largest palindrome product
##### Difficulty: Easy
##### Date: 2020-02-22

## Problem statement
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

##### Date: 2020-02-23

## Problem statement
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
